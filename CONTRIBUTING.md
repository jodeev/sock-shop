Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to the sock-shop! ðŸŽ‰ It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. All contributions are welcome, including new features, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and more.

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We have adopted this Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project:

- Submitting bug reports and feature requests in [Issues](https://github.com/jodeev/sock-shop/issues).
- Working on existing issues or feature requests by commenting on them and creating pull requests.
- Improving documentation to help new users or developers.
- Writing unit tests to make the codebase more reliable.
- Sharing the project and recommending it to others.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/jodeev/sock-shop/issues) to ensure the issue hasn't been reported before. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem.
- Provide specific examples, including code snippets if applicable.
- Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for sock-shop, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the repository to see if there's an existing issue or pull request addressing the issue.

Provide the following details:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most sock-shop users.

### Pull Requests

If there's an issue in our backlog that you want to work on, that is great! 

We definitely review pull requests that address open issues that we have accepted to our backlog. If there is not an existing issue for something you want to work on, please submit one, and we will review it and let you know if it is something we would consider. For existing open issues, here's how to submit a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, write necessary tests and ensure the test suite passes.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure your code follows the existing style of the project to maintain consistency.
5. Write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but substantial changes should have detailed messages.
6. Describe the changes you made in the pull request description, and refer to any related issues or pull requests.
7. Submit your pull request!

## Style Guide / Coding Conventions

Consistency is the most important. Following the existing style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file you are modifying and of the overall project. Failure to do so will result in a prolonged review process that has to focus on updating the superficial aspects of your code, rather than improving its functionality and performance.

For example, if all private properties are prefixed with an underscore _, then new ones you add should be prefixed in the same way. Or, if methods are named using camelcase, like thisIsMyNewMethod, then do not diverge from that by writing this_is_my_new_method. You get the idea. If in doubt, please ask or search the codebase for something similar.

When possible, style and format will be enforced with a linter.

## Community

(You may want to include sections about any communication channels you use, like a Discord server, IRC, mailing list, etc.)

Again, thank you for your interest in contributing to sock-shop! We look forward to your contributions.
